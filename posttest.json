    {
      "question": "Why do we add <code>+1</code> in LCS DP when characters match?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To count both characters",
        "b": "To extend an existing optimal subsequence",
        "c": "To move diagonally",
        "d": "To increase table size"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. One match adds one unit of length.",
        "b": "Correct! A match at (i, j) extends the LCS of (i-1, j-1).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Movement is a side effect of the recurrence.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Table size is independent of matching."

      "question": "When characters don't match in LCS, why take <code>max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])</code>?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To skip one character from either string",
        "b": "To ensure lexicographical order",
        "c": "To reduce space",
        "d": "To force recursion"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! We check which string's current character contributes less to the LCS.",
        "b": "Incorrect. LCS doesn't care about lexicography unless specified.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This step doesn't affect space complexity.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Recursion is a technique, not the goal."

        "b": "Reduced space complexity while allowing reconstruction",
        "c": "Simpler implementation",
        "d": "Handles more than 2 strings"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. It actually takes more time (roughly double).",
        "b": "Correct! It achieves O(n) space while still letting us find the LCS string.",
        "c": "Incorrect. It is much more complex than standard DP.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It's still for two strings."

      "question": "What does a tie in the DP table (e.g., dp[i-1][j] == dp[i][j-1]) imply?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The algorithm has an error",
        "b": "Multiple optimal subsequences exist",
        "c": "The strings are identical",
        "d": "The LCS length is 0"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is expected behavior.",
        "b": "Correct! It means there's more than one path to the same maximum length.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Ties happen frequently even in non-identical strings.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A tie can occur at any length."

      "question": "Why is pure recursion alone inefficient for LCS and Rod Cutting?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Stack overflow only",

        "c": "Cannot handle characters",
        "d": "Cannot find maximums"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Stack overflow is a limit, not the reason for inefficiency.",
        "b": "Correct! Without memoization, we solve the same state repeatedly.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Recursion handles any data type.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Recursion can find maximums easily."

        "c": "Memory usage (RAM)",
        "d": "Internet bandwidth"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. CPU time is linear-quadratic, but memory is the first 'hard' limit hit.",
        "b": "Incorrect. DP usually uses integers.",
        "c": "Correct! A 100k x 100k matrix would require gigabytes of RAM.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is local computation."

    {
      "question": "In Rod Cutting, why does the DP consider all possible first cuts?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To satisfy the compiler",
        "b": "Because any length cut could lead to the optimal solution",
        "c": "To increase code length",
        "d": "To use more memory"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Compilers don't dictate algorithm logic.",
        "b": "Correct! We must explore all i ∈ [1, n] to ensure optimality.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Experts prefer concise, correct code.",
