        "a": "Incorrect. A contiguous block is a <b>substring</b>.",
        "b": "Correct! A subsequence preserves relative order but allows gaps.",

        "a": "Incorrect. Fewer cuts don't always yield more money.",
        "b": "Correct! The goal is optimization of total revenue.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Shorter pieces often have higher combined value.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Profit is the primary metric, even if some rod is 'wasted' (though usually not an issue in this DP problem)."

        "a": "Incorrect. Greedy choices often fail in these problems.",
        "b": "Correct! Both problems can be solved by combining optimal solutions of smaller subproblems.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While they use recursion, pure D&C is inefficient without memoization.",

      "question": "Why use Dynamic Programming (DP) instead of a Greedy Algorithm (GA)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "GA is slow.",

        "c": "Correct! Overlapping subproblems are the reason we use DP.",

        "a": "Incorrect. It is defined as an empty string.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Length cannot be negative.",
        "c": "Correct! The only common subsequence is the empty string.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This would imply the strings match."

      "question": "In Rod Cutting, why can smaller pieces sometimes give more profit than one large piece?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Prices increase with cuts",

        "c": "Cutting reduces cost",
        "d": "Rod length changes"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Cutting doesn't inherently change the price of a segment.",
        "b": "Correct! Market value for pieces doesn't have to scale linearly with length.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Cutting itself is usually considered zero-cost in this problem.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Large inputs are handled by efficient algorithms.",

        "c": "Incorrect. Sorting doesn't apply.",
        "d": "Correct! Brute force would require checking 2ⁿ paths."
